PURPOSE
=======
This project aims at building a brand new forum software for the Romanian
PHP community ( http://www.phpromania.net/forum/ ).

For the moment though, the project is intended mainly as a common playground
for the above mentioned developers. A playground for testing and learning good
software development practices.


STEPS TOWARDS THE PURPOSE
========================
The first step for the moment is making sure the interested developers are able
to get a copy of the central source control repository. Instructions are in the
HOWTO-GIT file.

Second step: being able to run the automated tests. See HOWTO-TESTS for details.
Also, check out the problem found in tests/Forum/MathTest.php. It is a simple
exercise for getting you started with unit testing.
