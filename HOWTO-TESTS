In order to run the automated tests, first you must have intall PHPUnit
(http://www.phpunit.de/). This can be easily achieved using the pear command:

    pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com
    pear install --alldeps phpunit/PHPUnit

On some operating systems, you may need to log in as root to execute the last
command:

    sudo pear install --alldeps phpunit/PHPUnit

Next, cd to the "tests" directory and execute phpunit inside that directory:

    phpunit

The resulted output should look similar to this:

    PHPUnit 3.4.11 by Sebastian Bergmann.

    .F

    Time: 0 seconds, Memory: 8.50Mb

    There was 1 failure:

    1) HelloWorldTest::failingTest
    Failed asserting that <boolean:false> is true.

    FooTest.php:18

    FAILURES!
    Tests: 2, Assertions: 2, Failures: 1.

    Generating code coverage report, this may take a moment.


The phpunit command will auto-magically read the phpunit.xml file which can be
found in the tests directory and execute the tests accordingly to those
configurations.

If you're able to run the tests, then you're ready for real development.
